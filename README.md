## Introduction
Airbnb is an online marketplace for arranging lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. As of 2019, the platform had over 150 million registered users worldwide, and over 7 million listings in more than 220 countries and regions. However, the prices of the listings are not always consistent with their actual value. In this project, we will use ensemble machine learning to predict the prices of Airbnb listings in New York City.

## Introduction
Welcome to the Decision Tree Machine Learning Algorithm implementation from scratch! This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of decision tree algorithms and how they work. Decision trees are a powerful and widely used supervised learning technique in machine learning that can be used for classification and regression tasks. In this project, we have implemented the decision tree algorithm from scratch in Python, without using any external libraries or frameworks. This implementation includes functionality for tree construction and prediction. The code is well-documented and easy to understand.
